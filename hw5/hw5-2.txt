1. You have two cycles per incrementation plus 1 for the trig function since
it is calculating the same thing and therefore just uses memory to check
3n

2. This will be 3 cycles plus the cost of a trig function times n.
4n

3. This will take 3 cycles for the first loop happening n times and 5 cycles
for the second loop happening n^2/3 times
3n + 5n^2/3

4. This will take 5 cycles per iteration and will be n^2/2 iterations so
5/2n^2

5. This will take 2n + 2n^2 + 2n^3 for the two cycles in each iteration.

6. This will be n iterations and 4 cycles per iteration so
4n
