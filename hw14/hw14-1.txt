Yes f(n) is necessarilly theta(g(n)). Because g(n) = O(f(n)), there must be some c1 such that 
g(n) <= c1f(n) for all natural numbers n. Following this, there must be some c2 = 1/c1, such
that c2 g(n) <= f(n) for all natural numbers n. But this is the condition for f(n) = Omega(g(n))
so we know that f(n) = Omega(g(n)). In addition, because we were told that f(n) = O(g(n)), we know
that f(n) must be theta(g(n)).

3.6 a. An edge is, by definition, something which connects two vertices and is incident upon both of them
so the number of incidents, following this definition of edges, must necessarily be 2|E|.

b. We know from a that the total number of incidencs is even. The total degree of vertices with even
degrees will be even and the sum total, which must be even, is equal to the evens plus the odds so
the odd vertices must have an even number of degrees. But this would only happen if there are an odd
number of vertices with odd degrees is even, so that is the case, as desired.

c. No, because the sum degree of the graph is just |E| which can be either odd or even and, if its odd
that would mean that we have an odd number of vertices whose degree is odd
