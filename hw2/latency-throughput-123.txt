#1. dividing with a latency of 20-80 is the highest
#2. We see higher latency and reciprocal throughput when we move between registers and memory.
#3. The reciprocal throughput is lower because, if the computer doesn't need to wait
for a response it is more efficient and can process multiple things at once.
